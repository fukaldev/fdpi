# FDPI - DPI Tool for Network Flow Protobuf Generation

FDPI is a DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) tool written in Rust that generates a protobuf representation of network flows. It listens on a specified network interface, processes packets at each layer, and fills a protobuf message with the relevant information.

## Features

- Captures network packets on a specified interface
- Parses packets at each layer (Ethernet, IP, TCP/UDP, etc.)
- Generates a protobuf message representing the network flow
- Supports customization and configuration options

## Installation

To use FDPI, you'll need to have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone the FDPI repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/fdpi.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd fdpi`
3. Build the project: `cargo build`
4. Run the application: `cargo run`

## Usage

FDPI can be used as a standalone tool or integrated into other projects. Here's an example of how to use it:
5. Run the application with a specific interface: `cargo run <interface-name>`
